# Bellabeats-Case-Study

## Introduction

This repository showcases my second capstone project for the Google Data Analytics course through Coursera. The course focused on using the Google Workspace, BigQuery, and posit(R), so I decided to focus on Kaggle. Kaggle is a platform that was briefly covered in the course but I wanted to gain a deeper understanding for so I utilized this project for just that!

 All data was accessed through public use via the course itself and is included in the [Resources](#resources) section of the README.

### Project Goals
- Get comfortable with Kaggle and strengthen my understanding of R.
- Identify trends in fitbit user data for Bellabeat.

## Findings

Here are the main things I found:
- Users with higher periods of inactivity showed less sleep.
  
- There is a soft peak in intensity at noon and a second peak around 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm
  
- Contrary to sedentary findings, intesntiy and workout data showed no obvious coorelation to sleep, meaning that no excecise = poor sleep while more excercise offered no harm/benefit to sleep.
  
- In my opinion a target on consumers with difficulty sleeping could help Bellabeats compete. Focusing on pushing people to be active for the porpuse of benefiting their sleep.
